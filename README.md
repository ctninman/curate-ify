## Overview

*Curate-ify* is a an alternate version of Spotify designed for users who prefer to curate an album collection and listen to music in a full album format. Users can listen to albums within the *Curate-ify* application, or choose to open a selected album in Spotify.

Albums can be added to a user's collection, or to a separate queue, which is used to house a separate grouping of albums that a user may want to listen to, but does not wish to place in their collection.

Each album in a user's collection can be given multiple tags and genres, and a user can browse through albums in their collection filtered by these tags and genres.
